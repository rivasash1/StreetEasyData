StreetEasy 1 Bedroom Median Asking Rent in NYC 

cleaned data from StreetEasy to show the median asking rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in NYC 5 Boroughs: Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island from 2010 - 2023.

Yearly monthly median was found by taking the median asking rent of each month per year. 

In this project I examined the rent in all 5 boroughs for the last 5 years 2017-2022 to analyze trends. 

Data from 2023 was not used since the data is still being collected as the year has not yet ended. 

Table information:
